# HISTORY

## Version 0.7.1

* OutputManager handles output from StatSailr.
    + This enables annotations to outputs, and those outputs can be formatted for various types such as text and html based on those annotations.
* PROC settings are now separated from this gem.
    + They are managed as a separate gem, statsailr_procs_base gem.
    + Other PROC setting gems can be used, if they follow appropriate structure.

## Version 0.7.0

* Initial commit & Merry Christmas (12/25/2020)
  + StatSailr has reached a working version.
